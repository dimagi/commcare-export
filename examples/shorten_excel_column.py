"""
This script reads an Excel file and modifies the values in Column B
by shortening dot-separated strings.

Specifically:
- For each string in Column B:
    - If it contains one or more dots, only the last segment is retained.
    - If there is no dot, the string is left unchanged.
- The updated data is saved to a new Excel file called 'shortend_Team-Member-Registration-DET.xlsx'.

Use Case:
This is useful for simplifying verbose or hierarchical field names
(e.g., 'form.section.group.field' â†’ 'field') for better readability,
especially when preparing data for database headers, analytics, or display.

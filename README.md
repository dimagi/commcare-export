A command-line tool (and Python library) to generate customized exports from the [CommCare HQ](https://www.commcarehq.org) [REST API](https://wiki.commcarehq.org/display/commcarepublic/Data+APIs).

* [User documentation](https://wiki.commcarehq.org/display/commcarepublic/CommCare+Data+Export+Tool)
* [Changelog](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-export/releases)

Installation & Quick Start
--------------------------

Following commands are to be run on a terminal or a command line.

Once on a terminal window or command line, for simplicity, run commands from the home directory.

### Python

Check which Python version is installed.

This tool is tested with Python versions from 3.8 to 3.12.

```shell
$ python3 --version
```
If Python is installed, its version will be shown.

If Python isn't installed, [download and install](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
a version of Python from 3.8 to 3.12.

## Virtualenv (Optional)

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for CommCare Export
to avoid conflicts with other Python applications.

More about virtualenvs on https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

Setup a virtual environment using:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate virtual environment by running:

```shell
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

**Note**: virtualenv needs to be activated each time you start a new terminal session or command line prompt.

For convenience, to avoid doing that, you can create an alias to activate virtual environments in
"venv" directory by adding the following to your
`.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```shell
$ alias venv='if [[ -d venv ]] ; then source venv/bin/activate ; fi'
```

Then you can activate virtual environments with simply typing
```shell
$ venv
```

## Install CommCare Export

Install CommCare Export via `pip`

```shell
$ pip install commcare-export
```

## CommCare HQ

1. Sign up for [CommCare HQ](https://www.commcarehq.org/) if you have not already.

2. Create a project space and application.

3. Visit the Release Manager, make a build, click the star to release it.

4. Use Web Apps and fill out some forms.

5. Modify one of example queries in the `examples/` directory, modifying the "Filter Value" column
    to match your form XMLNS / case type. 
    See [this page](https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/Finding+a+Form%27s+XMLNS) to 
    determine the XMLNS for your form.

Now you can run the following examples:

```shell
$ commcare-export \
     --query examples/demo-registration.xlsx \
     --project YOUR_PROJECT \
     --output-format markdown

$ commcare-export \
     --query examples/demo-registration.json \
     --project YOUR_PROJECT \
     --output-format markdown

$ commcare-export \
     --query examples/demo-deliveries.xlsx \
     --project YOUR_PROJECT \
     --output-format markdown

$ commcare-export \
     --query examples/demo-deliveries.json \
     --project YOUR_PROJECT \
     --output-format markdown
```

You'll see the tables printed out. Change to `--output-format sql --output URL_TO_YOUR_DB --since DATE` to
sync all forms submitted since that date.

Example query files are provided in both Excel and JSON format.  It is recommended
to use the Excel format as the JSON format may change upon future library releases.

Command-line Usage
------------------

The basic usage of the command-line tool is with a saved Excel or JSON query (see how to write these, below)

```shell
$ commcare-export --commcare-hq <URL or alias like "local" or "prod"> \
                  --username <username> \
                  --project <project> \
                  --api-version <api version, defaults to latest known> \
                  --version <print current version> \
                  --query <excel file, json file, or raw json> \
                  --output-format <csv, xls, xlsx, json, markdown, sql> \
                  --output <file name or SQL database URL> \
                  --users <export data about project's mobile workers> \
                  --locations <export data about project's location hierarchy> \
                  --with-organization <export users, locations and joinable form or case tables>
```

See `commcare-export --help` for the full list of options.

There are example query files for the CommCare Demo App (available on the CommCare HQ Exchange) in the `examples/`
directory.

`--output`

CommCare Export uses SQLAlachemy's [create_engine](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html) to establish a database connection. This is based off of the [RFC-1738](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt) protocol. Some common examples:

```
# Postgres
postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase

# MySQL
mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase

# MSSQL
mssql+pyodbc://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabases?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server
```


Excel Queries
-------------

An Excel query is any `.xlsx` workbook. Each sheet in the workbook represents one table you wish
to create. There are two grouping of columns to configure the table:

 - **Data Source**: Set this to `form` to export form data, or `case` for case data.
 - **Filter Name** / *Filter Value*: These columns are paired up to filter the input cases or forms.
 - **Field**: The destination in your SQL database for the value.
 - **Source Field**: The particular field from the form you wish to extract. This can be any JSON path.


JSON Queries
------------

JSON queries are a described in the table below. You build a JSON object that represents the query you have in mind.
A good way to get started is to work from the examples, or you could make an Excel query and run the tool
with `--dump-query` to see the resulting JSON query.


User and Location Data
----------------------

The --users and --locations options export data from a CommCare project that
can be joined with form and case data. The --with-organization option does all
of that and adds a field to Excel query specifications to be joined on.

Specifying the --users option or --with-organization option will export an
additional table named 'commcare_users' containing the following columns:

| Column                           | Type | Note                                |
|----------------------------------|------|-------------------------------------|
| id                               | Text | Primary key                         |
| default_phone_number             | Text |                                     |
| email                            | Text |                                     |
| first_name                       | Text |                                     |
| groups                           | Text |                                     |
| last_name                        | Text |                                     |
| phone_numbers                    | Text |                                     |
| resource_uri                     | Text |                                     |
| commcare_location_id             | Text | Foreign key to `commcare_locations` |
| commcare_location_ids            | Text |                                     |
| commcare_primary_case_sharing_id | Text |                                     |
| commcare_project                 | Text |                                     |
| username                         | Text |                                     |

The data in the 'commcare_users' table comes from the [List Mobile Workers
API endpoint](https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/List+Mobile+Workers).

Specifying the --locations option or --with-organization options will export
an additional table named 'commcare_locations' containing the following columns:

| Column                       | Type | Note                                          |
|------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| id                           | Text |                                               |
| created_at                   | Date |                                               |
| domain                       | Text |                                               |

| last_modified                | Date |                                               |
| latitude                     | Text |                                               |
| location_data                | Text |                                               |

| location_type_name           | Text |                                               |
| location_type_parent         | Text |                                               |
| *location level code*        | Text | Column name depends on project's organization |
| *location level code*        | Text | Column name depends on project's organization |

The data in the 'commcare_locations' table comes from the Location API
endpoint along with some additional columns from the Location Type API
endpoint. The last columns in the table exist if you have set up
organization levels for your projects. One column is created for each
organization level. The column name is derived from the Location Type
that you specified. The column value is the location_id of the containing
location at that level of your organization. Consider the example organization
from the [CommCare help page](https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/Setting+up+Organization+Levels+and+Structure).
A piece of the 'commcare_locations' table could look like this:

| location_id | location_type_name | chw    | supervisor | clinic | district |
|-------------|--------------------|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| 939fa8      | District           | NULL   | NULL       | NULL   | 939fa8   |
| c4cbef      | Clinic             | NULL   | NULL       | c4cbef | 939fa8   |
| a9ca40      | Supervisor         | NULL   | a9ca40     | c4cbef | 939fa8   |
| 4545b9      | CHW                | 4545b9 | a9ca40     | c4cbef | 939fa8   |

In order to join form or case data to 'commcare_users' and 'commcare_locations'
the exported forms and cases need to contain a field identifying which user
submitted them. The --with-organization option automatically adds a field
called 'commcare_userid' to each query in an Excel specification for this
purpose. Using that field, you can use a SQL query with a join to report
data about any level of you organization. For example, to count the number
of forms submitted by all workers in each clinic:

```sql
SELECT l.clinic,
       COUNT(*)
FROM form_table t
LEFT JOIN (commcare_users u
           LEFT JOIN commcare_locations l
           ON u.commcare_location_id = l.location_id)
ON t.commcare_userid = u.id
GROUP BY l.clinic;
```

Note that the table names 'commcare_users' and 'commcare_locations' are
treated as reserved names and the export tool will produce an error if
given a query specification that writes to either of them.

The export tool will write all users to 'commcare_users' and all locations to
'commcare_locations', overwriting existing rows with current data and adding
rows for new users and locations. If you want to remove obsolete users or
locations from your tables, drop them and the next export will leave only
the current ones. If you modify your organization to add or delete levels,
you will change the columns of the 'commcare_locations' table and it is
very likely you will want to drop the table before exporting with the new
organization.

Python Library Usage
--------------------

As a library, the various `commcare_export` modules make it easy to

 - Interact with the CommCare HQ REST API
 - Execute "Minilinq" queries against the API (a very simple query language, described below)
 - Load and save JSON representations of Minilinq queries
 - Compile Excel configurations to Minilinq queries

To directly access the CommCare HQ REST API:

```python
from commcare_export.checkpoint import CheckpointManagerWithDetails
from commcare_export.commcare_hq_client import CommCareHqClient, AUTH_MODE_APIKEY
from commcare_export.commcare_minilinq import get_paginator, PaginationMode

username = 'some@username.com'
domain = 'your-awesome-domain'
hq_host = 'https://commcarehq.org'
API_KEY= 'your_secret_api_key'

api_client = CommCareHqClient(hq_host, domain, username, API_KEY, AUTH_MODE_APIKEY)
case_paginator=get_paginator(resource='case', pagination_mode=PaginationMode.date_modified)
case_paginator.init()
checkpoint_manager=CheckpointManagerWithDetails(None, None, PaginationMode.date_modified)

cases = api_client.iterate('case', case_paginator, checkpoint_manager=checkpoint_manager)

for case in cases:
	print(case['case_id'])

```

To issue a `minilinq` query against it, and then print out that query in a JSON serialization:

```python
import json
import sys
from commcare_export.minilinq import *
from commcare_export.commcare_hq_client import CommCareHqClient
from commcare_export.commcare_minilinq import CommCareHqEnv
from commcare_export.env import BuiltInEnv, JsonPathEnv
from commcare_export.writers import StreamingMarkdownTableWriter

api_client = CommCareHqClient(
    url="http://www.commcarehq.org",
    project='your_project',
    username='your_username',
    password='password',
    version='0.5'
)

source = Map(
   source=Apply(
       Reference("api_data"),
       Literal("form"),
       Literal({"filter": {"term": {"app_id": "whatever"}}})
   ),
   body=List([
       Reference("received_on"),
       Reference("form.gender"),
   ])
)

query = Emit(
   'demo-table',
   [
       Literal('Received On'),
       Literal('Gender')
   ],
   source
)

print(json.dumps(query.to_jvalue(), indent=2))

results = query.eval(BuiltInEnv() | CommCareHqEnv(api_client) | JsonPathEnv())

if len(list(env.emitted_tables())) > 0:
    with StreamingMarkdownTableWriter(sys.stdout) as writer:
        for table in env.emitted_tables():
            writer.write_table(table)
```

Which will output JSON equivalent to this:

```json
{
    "Emit": {
        "headings": [
            {
                "Lit": "Received On"
            },
            {
                "Lit": "Gender"
            }
        ],
        "source": {
            "Map": {
                "body": {
                    "List": [
                        {
                            "Ref": "received_on"
                        },
                        {
                            "Ref": "form.gender"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "name": null,
                "source": {
                    "Apply": {
                        "args": [
                            {
                                "Lit": "form"
                            },
                            {
                                "Lit": {
                                    "filter": {
                                        "term": {
                                            "app_id": "whatever"
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        ],
                        "fn": {
                            "Ref": "api_data"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "table": "demo-table"
    }
}
```


MiniLinq Reference
------------------

The abstract syntax can be directly inspected in the `commcare_export.minilinq` module. Note that the choice between functions and primitives is deliberately chosen
to expose the structure of the MiniLinq for possible optimization, and to restrict the overall language.

Here is a description of the astract syntax and semantics

| Python                        | JSON                                                | Which is evaluates to            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `Literal(v)`                  | `{"Lit": v}`                                        | Just `v`                         |
| `Reference(x)`                | `{"Ref": x}`                                        | Whatever `x` resolves to in the environment |
| `List([a, b, c, ...])`        | `{"List": [a, b, c, ...}`                           | The list of what `a`, `b`, `c` evaluate to |
| `Map(source, name, body)`     | `{"Map": {"source": ..., "name": ..., "body": ...}` | Evals `body` for each elem in `source`. If `name` is provided, the elem will be bound to it, otherwise it will replace the whole env. |
| `FlatMap(source, name, body)` | `{"FlatMap": {"source" ... etc}}` | Flattens after mapping, like nested list comprehensions |
| `Filter(source, name, body)`  | etc | |
| `Bind(value, name, body)`     | etc | Binds the result of `value` to `name` when evaluating `body` |
| `Emit(table, headings, rows)` | etc | Emits `table` with `headings` and `rows`. Note that `table` is a string, `headings` is a list of expressions, and `rows` is a list of lists of expressions. See explanation below for emitted output. |
| `Apply(fn, args)` | etc | Evaluates `fn` to a function, and all of `args`, then applies the function to the args. |

Built in functions like `api_data` and basic arithmetic and comparison are provided via the environment,
referred to be name using `Ref`, and utilized via `Apply`.

Output Formats
--------------

Your MiniLinq may define multiple tables with headings in addition to their body rows by using `Emit`
expressions, or may simply return the results of a single query.

If your MiniLinq does not contain any `Emit` expressions, then the results of the expression will be
printed to standard output as pretty-printed JSON.

If your MiniLinq _does_ contain `Emit` expressions, then there are many formats available, selected
via the `--output-format <format>` option, and it can be directed to a file with the `--output <file>` command-line option.

 - `csv`: Each table will be a CSV file within a Zip archive.
 - `xls`: Each table will be a sheet in an old-format Excel spreadsheet.
 - `xlsx`: Each table will be a sheet in a new-format Excel spreadsheet.
 - `json`: The tables will each be a member of a JSON dictionary, printed to standard output
 - `markdown`: The tables will be streamed to standard output in Markdown format (very handy for debugging your queries)
 - `sql`: All data will be idempotently "upserted" into the SQL database you specify, including creating the needed tables and columns.


Dependencies
------------

Required dependencies will be automatically installed via pip. But since
you may not care about all export formats, the various dependencies there
are optional. Here is how you might install them:

```shell
# To export "xlsx"
$ pip install "commcare-export[xlsx]"

# To export "xls"
$ pip install "commcare-export[xls]"

# To sync with a Postgres database
$ pip install "commcare-export[postgres]"

# To sync with a mysql database
$ pip install "commcare-export[mysql]"

# To sync with a database which uses odbc (e.g. mssql)
$ pip install "commcare-export[odbc]"

# To sync with another SQL database supported by SQLAlchemy
$ pip install "commcare-export[base_sql]"
# Then install the Python package for your database
```

$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -e ".[test]"
$ git checkout -b my-super-duper-feature
```

3\. Make your edits.

4\. Make sure the tests pass. The best way to test for all versions is to sign up for https://travis-ci.org and turn on automatic continuous testing for your fork.

```shell
$ py.test
=============== test session starts ===============
platform darwin -- Python 2.7.3 -- pytest-2.3.4
collected 17 items

tests/test_commcare_minilinq.py .
tests/test_excel_query.py ....

tests/test_repeatable_iterator.py .
tests/test_writers.py ...

============ 17 passed in 2.09 seconds ============
```

5\. Type hints are used in the `env` and `minilinq` modules. Check that any changes in those modules adhere to those types:

```shell
$ mypy --install-types @mypy_typed_modules.txt
```

6\. Push the feature branch up

```shell
$ git push -u origin my-super-duper-feature
```

7\. Visit https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-export and submit a pull request.

8\. Accept our gratitude for contributing: Thanks!

Release process
---------------

1\. Create a tag for the release

```shell
$ git tag -a "X.YY.0" -m "Release X.YY.0"
$ git push --tags
```

2\. Create the source distribution

```shell
$ python setup.py sdist
```
Ensure that the archive (`dist/commcare-export-X.YY.0.tar.gz`) has the correct version number (matching the tag name).

3\. Upload to pypi

```shell
$ pip install twine
$ twine upload -u dimagi dist/commcare-export-X.YY.0.tar.gz
```

4\. Verify upload

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/commcare-export

5\. Create a release on github

https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-export/releases

Once the release is published a GitHub workflow is kicked off that compiles an executable of the DET compatible with
running on a Linux machine (Windows coming soon), adding it as a release asset.

If you decide to download and use the executable file, please make sure the file has the executable permission enabled,
after which it can be invoked like any other executable though the command line.


Testing and Test Databases
--------------------------

The following command will run the entire test suite (requires DB environment variables to be set as per below):

```shell
$ py.test
```

To run an individual test class or method you can run, e.g.:

```shell
$ py.test -k "TestExcelQuery"
$ py.test -k "test_get_queries_from_excel"
```

To exclude the database tests you can run:

```shell
$ py.test -m "not dbtest"
```

When running database tests, supported databases are PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL.

To run tests against selected databases can be done using test marks as follows:
```shell
$ py.test -m [postgres,mysql,mssql]
```

Database URLs can be overridden via environment variables:
```
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/
MYSQL_URL=mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/
MSSQL_URL=mssql+pyodbc://user:password@host/
```

Postgresql
==========
```shell
$ docker pull postgres:9.6
$ docker run --name ccexport-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres:9.6
$ export POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/
```

[Docker postgres image docs](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)

MySQL
=====
```shell
$ docker pull mysql
$ docker run --name ccexport-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pw -e MYSQL_USER=travis -e MYSQL_PASSWORD='' -d mysql

# create travis user
$ docker run -it --link ccexport-mysql:mysql --rm mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"'
mysql> CREATE USER 'travis'@'%';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'travis'@'%';
```

MSSQL
=====
```shell
$ docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest 
$ docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Password@123" -p 1433:1433 --name mssql1 -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-latest

# install driver
$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/prod $(lsb_release -rs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install msodbcsql17
$ odbcinst -q -d
```

MSSQL for Mac OS

# Create a soft link from /etc/odbcinst.ini to actual file
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini /etc/odbcinst.ini

```

Integration Tests
-----------------
Running the integration tests requires API credentials from CommCare HQ
that have access to the `corpora` domain. This user should only have
access to the corpora domain.

These need to be set as environment variables as follows:

```shell
$ export HQ_USERNAME=<username>
$ export HQ_API_KEY=<apikey>
```

For Travis builds these are included as encrypted vars in the travis
config.
